<p>Currently I'm working on a private project called 'Auto reminder' which allows business to send on regular basis text messages, for example if you have a dentis appointment in one week so that you get 3 days and also 2 hours before the appointment a text message so you don't miss the appointment. Not sure if this project will take off but it is sure worth a try ;)</p>
