- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my personal portfolio/blog website https://danobe.dev
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all about Web Development (NextJS & React, MDX, TypeScript)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for good ideas in general to move something in the world :) You got a idea and need someone to work on it even just a fun project?<br> Hit me up, exchange of information is free ;)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: All my information is sitting on the left of my profile :) or even on my website.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I may not be the best developer in the world but my energy flows towards to become the best developer possible I can for myself :)

Due to the fact that I'm working currently in a comapny I don't have time to push very often new content to my website or work on personal/community projects.
